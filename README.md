Hello! I'm Tahia Islam.

I'm a CS student. 

I build whatever seems fun and interesting to me!

I also built this fun Space Cafe Game App with React: [Space Cafe Game](https://github.com/NotCheery/Space-Cafe-Game)

For a hackathon in a team of 4, I dived into backend engineering with Node and Express, creating RESTful API: [Medi-QR](https://github.com/natalyyau/Medi-QR)

Let's connect!

You can contact me at itahia05@gmail.com

In my spare time, I enjoy painting, sketching, and playing games. I'm a creative person which really shines in my apps :)
